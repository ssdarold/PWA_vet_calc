## Overview

The Veterinary Clinic Dosage Calculator is a JavaScript and HTML script developed as a Progressive Web Application (PWA). It provides a convenient way for veterinary clinics to calculate the required dosage of a medication for animals.

The script offers two modes of operation:

1. Single Dose Calculation: Calculates the dosage of a medication for a single administration based on the weight of the animal and the desired dosage per kilogram of weight.
2. Constant Rate Infusion Calculation: Calculates the dosage and infusion rate for continuous medication administration based on the weight of the animal, desired dosage per kilogram of weight, concentration of the medication, infusion rate, and syringe volume.

## Key Features
